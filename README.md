# C-Programs-Complete-Guide-and-Documentation

<p> Before we can begin to write programs in C, it would be intresting to find out what really is C, how it came into existence and how does it compare with other programming languages. In this chapter, we would briefly outline these issues. <br> Four important aspects of any languages are - the way it stores the data, how it accomplishes input and output, and how it lets you control the sequence of execution of instructions in a program. We would discuss the first three of these building blocks in this chapter.</p>
